casperMint v0.0.1
=========

A casperJS script I created to scrape recent transactions from mint.com. It needs a lot of work, but it works. Currently it just grabs your pending transactions and echo's out the most recent one. 

Pull requests are welcomed with open arms :)

Expected Usage
------


`
casperjs mint.js --email=youremail@example.com --password=supersecretpassword
